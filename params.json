Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org/) and [Python](http://python.org/) (for mongodb bson npm module).\r\n\r\n2. Install otagai.js globally:\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   npm install -g otagai\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Navigate to a directory where you have rights to create files, and type:\r\n   ```sh\r\n   otagai new app\r\n   ```\r\n   This will create an otagai.js application called App in a directory called app and install the npm dependencies.\r\n\r\n4. Change into the app directory and start development server\r\n   ```sh\r\n   cd app\r\n   otagai server dev\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n## CLI usage\r\n### Server\r\n  To use these commands you must be in app folder.\r\n  To run application in production mode:\r\n   ```sh\r\n   otagai server prod\r\n   ```\r\n  To stop application:\r\n   ```sh\r\n   otagai server stop\r\n   ```\r\n  To restart:\r\n   ```sh\r\n   otagai server restart\r\n   ```\r\n  You may restart server forced with ```-f``` flag.\r\n  This kill all node and mongo processes.\r\n\r\n### Admin user\r\n   ```sh\r\n   otagai createuser -u username -e email@adress.com -p password\r\n   ```\r\n   Creates a superuser account (a user who has all default permissions).\r\n   This command useful for create initial user account.\r\n\r\n### Generators\r\n   For generate model:\r\n   ```sh\r\n   otagai gen model demo -f name:string,count:number\r\n   ```\r\n   Controller:\r\n   ```sh\r\n   otagai gen controller demo\r\n   ```\r\n   Views:\r\n   ```sh\r\n   otagai gen views demo\r\n   ```\r\n   Scaffold (model, controller, views):\r\n   ```sh\r\n   otagai gen scaffold demo -f name:string,count:number\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n## Inspiration\r\nProject based on [form5-node-express-mongoose-coffeescript](https://github.com/olafurnielsen/form5-node-express-mongoose-coffeescript)\r\n\r\nOtagai.js thinks to develop as modular framework, focused on convenience and speed of development: livereload, fast transparent preprocessing, easy database migrations and deploying. This is collection of massive patterns and best Node.js practicals.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
